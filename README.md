# Credit Card Database Scan

First, make sure you have [Node js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed.

In the root directory, install the packages

```bash
npm install
```

Then, build the project and start

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

If any credit cards are detected, they are outputted in a csv file in a generated _"Reports"_ directory

## Note

If you are using this with an oracle database, make you sure you download the drivers and move then to the root project folder with folder name _instant_oracle_client_
